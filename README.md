# QuoteGenerator
Generates a new quote and displays it when the website is loaded and when a button is clicked. 
There is also a button that will allow the quote to be shared through Twitter.
This A simple project to get familiar with some web development paradigms with JavaScript.

# Live Project
See the project in action [here](https://itsgabeyo.github.io/QuoteGenerator/).

# Online Tools
• The quotes are pulled from the [Forismatic](https://forismatic.com/en/api/) API.

• An icon pulled from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) is used in the tab head.

• Background was made using [Heropatterns](https://www.heropatterns.com/).

• The font used is a Google font [Montserrat Alternates](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates?query=mon).

• Uses a [NodeJS proxy](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/) hosted on a free account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
  This gets around a CORS origin error and a too many requests error when pulling a quote from an API.
